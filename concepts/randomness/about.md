## Explanation

The Math.random() function returns a floating-point, pseudo-random number in the range 0 to less than 1 (inclusive of 0, but not 1) with approximately uniform distribution over that range â€” which you can then scale to your desired range. The implementation selects the initial seed to the random number generation algorithm; it cannot be chosen or reset by the user.

### Example

```javascript
function getRandomInt(max) {
  return Math.floor(Math.random() * max);
}

console.log(getRandomInt(3));
// expected output: 0, 1 or 2

console.log(getRandomInt(1));
// expected output: 0

console.log(Math.random());
// expected output: a number from 0 to <1
